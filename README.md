This paper, Multi-label chest X-ray image classification via category-wise residual attention learning, appears in [PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865518308559), 2018.

## Overview
In this paper, we propose a category-wise residual attention learning (CRAL) framework. CRAL predicts the presence of multiple pathologies in a class-specific attentive view. The proposed framework consists of two modules: feature embedding module and attention learning module. The feature embedding module learns high-level features with a convolutional neural network (CNN) while the attention learning module focuses on exploring the assignment scheme of different categories.
